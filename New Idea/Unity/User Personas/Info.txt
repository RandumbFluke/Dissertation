Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. 

It has been reported that 18 years ago the human eye could see about 250 stars in the night sky. But as of today, only about 100 stars are visible. Due to high levels of pollution and the effect of urban lighting, the night sky is brightening, and making stars disappear.

Artificial lighting that escapes into the sky causes it to glow, preventing humans and animals from seeing the stars.
